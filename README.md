> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is the CSSE2310 style checker hacked to work with the CSSE3010 style guide. Do your style checks manually, I'm not responsible if it doesn't pick up all your style violations.

`nett` is command-line utility used to perform style
checking on C source files. It checks for
compliance with the style guide used by the 
<s>CSSE2310</s> CSSE3010 programming course at the University of Queensland.

## Usage

The program has the following modes of operation:

1. Perform style checking on a set of source files
    and output all found violations to the terminal
    (default)

    ```
    nett file1 [file2 ...]
    ```

2. Perform style checking on a set of source files
    and generate `.styled` files containing a
    capped number of violations found.

    ```
    nett --generate-files file1 [file2 ...]
    ```
    The generated `.styled` files will be created in the same
    directory as the original source files provided.

## Installation
`nett` is written using the Clang Libtooling framework.
In order to build the program, its source code is
required to be stored within a checked-out LLVM git
repository under `llvm-project/clang-tools-extra`.

To do this, run the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git && \
  cd llvm-project && \
  cd clang-tools-extra && \
  git submodule add https://github.com/TheBrokenPipe/3010-nett.git && \
  cd nett
```

Once the `nett` source files are in place (under
`llvm-project/clang-tools-extra`), it can be built
using the provided build script

```
./build.sh
```

> Note that the build process requires 
> [`cmake`](https://cmake.org/install/) and 
> [`ninja`](https://ninja-build.org) 
> to be installed beforehand. 

## Tests

To check that the program works correctly, you can run the 
test suite using the provided test script

```
./runtests.sh
```

## Docker Compatibility
`nett` is also available via Docker Hub. To build the docker image
from scratch, run

```
docker build -t nett .
```

To run the program via the publicly available docker image
(`dgrobb/nett`), you can use the provided wrapper script:

```
./nettrun.py [--generate-files] file [file ...]
```

This script wraps the `docker run` command and takes care of 
mounting the necessary directories for the program to work correctly.
